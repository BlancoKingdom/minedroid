= Getting the source =

The source is organised in three Eclipse projects: You'll need the DroidRUGL project from [http://code.google.com/p/rugl/source/browse/#svn/trunk/droid this] repository, and also the projects from [http://minedroid.googlecode.com here] and [http://preflect.googlecode.com here].
