= Getting the source =

The source is organised in three Eclipse projects:
	
http://code.google.com/p/rugl/source/browse/#svn/trunk/droid
	
You'll need the DroidRUGL project from that repository, and also the projects at
	
	minedroid.googlecode.com
	preflect.googlecode.com
	
For those with an Eclipse compiler setup as prissy as mine, the missing javadoc warnings are Google's fault.
	
== step-by-step ==

1) Download and install "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" from
	http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

2) Open Eclipse and create a new workspace

3) Install the subclipse SVN plugin for eclipse. Instructions at
	http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=p4wYuA

4) Install the Android development tools and ADT eclipse plugin.
	http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html

5) Add the SVN repositories to subclipse:
    In Eclipse, "Window" menu - "Open Perspective" - "Other"
    Choose "SVN Repository Exploring"
    Right-click in the currently-blank "SVN Repositories" tab. "New" - 
		"Repository Location..."
	The URLs for the repositories are 
		"https://rugl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk"
		"https://preflect.googlecode.com/svn/trunk"
		"https://minedroid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk"
	Add each of these

6) Check out the projects:
 6.1) Click on "https://rugl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk", to open it. Click on "droid", then right-click on "DroidRUGL". Select "Check out..." from the menu, hit OK in the dialog box.
		
6.2) From "https://preflect.googlecode.com/svn/trunk", you need the "Preflect" project

6.3) From "https://minedroid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk", you need the "MineDroid" project

=== 7) You've now got local copies of the code - huzzah! ===
