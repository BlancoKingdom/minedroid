To get the most out of MineDroid its best to play around with the settings, here you will find how to use and automatically apply settings.

== Find what you're looking for ==

pressing the menu key will open the menu (kinda obvious) here is a tree of all options in the menu

 * [BlockView] - MineDroid settings, expands to
  * Camera - view and steering options (look in here for the *view invert* option)
  * Interface (contains control options like sensor steering touch pad controls etc.)
  * Player (contains fly/ghost mode, reset location, and advanced player options)
  * Sky colour
  * World (chunk loading and render options)
 * [DroidRUGL] - Not much of interest in here, you can safely ignore this one

 # Pressing the back or menu key on the first menu will open a pop up showing "Apply", "Persist" and "Cancel".
 # Choose "Persist".
 # Choose "Save"
 # Hit "New"
 # Enter *default* (note all lower-case) as the save name
